1. Your table that gives a description of each file and filenames was a really good idea.
 It helped us to find different your different files and gave us an idea of what files you had

2. Having to find and view different graphs for each transcript was difficult. 
We think making one big graph would be easier to find and view

3. We liked that you used a shebang in your scripts! Makes it easier for other people to run 

4. Organizing your repo would also help viewers to find things easier
